        <p>Hello, my name is Thomas Winters. I am originally from Tennessee where I studied mathematics at the University of Tennessee.
        When I graduated college, I decided to move somewhere different and chose Minnesota as my mom and her family lived there.
        I have worked mainly in retail and hospitality moving from OfficeMax to Applebeeâ€™s and then to Renters Warehouse.
        I enjoyed the people aspect of the jobs, taking care of them, helping them acquire and purchase what they wanted and so forth;
        however, there was a lack of motivation from these positions that I could not find. I decided to look at what I wanted in my career
        and this lead me to looking at a coding boot camp. I joined the web developer boot camp at the University of Minnesota as I felt this
        was exactly the challenge and motivation I needed. I get to be creative, logical and more importantly, I get to continue my ability
        to help others.</p>
        <p>Besides my professional side, I enjoy reading, watching movies/television and have been really committed on becoming more fit and healthier.
        My guilty pleasure is of course, YouTube. I never understood the spiral of YouTube until it took me for a joy ride one evening. Watching
        video after video about all sorts of things is fascinating to me and can keep me occupied for hours. I have grown out of it lately, but I
        used to love playing video games, more specifically, first person shooters. Used to be a great stress reliever, but boot camp has kept me
        busy ðŸ˜Š</p>
